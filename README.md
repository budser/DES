AutoHotkey hotstrings to annihilate DES drudgery

Script assembled by Aron Talenfeld (p 650.485.3033 | e budser@gmail.com)

Getting started: 

1) Download a portable copy (no installation required) of AHK from https://autohotkey.com/download/ 
   (Follow the link "Download AutoHotkey .zip" to download and extract "AutoHotkeyU64.exe" to a safe place on your hard drive)

2) Save the DES.ahk file to a safe place on your hard drive. Edit it in NotePad++ (available at notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/ ) or the text editor of your choice. 

   Do a "search and replace all" to replace "[DEFAULT]" with your local directory.

3) Select Autohotkey.exe as the default program to open DES.ahk. 

4) Create a shortcut to DES.ahk in the startup folder so that your script will load with Windows 
   (i.e. C:\Users\[yourAlias]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup)
